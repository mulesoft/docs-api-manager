As the Organization Administrator of the root organization, you can revoke or delete a contract that is providing an application access to your API. When you revoke a contract, you can restore the contract at any time. 

Deleting a contract deletes the approved contract from Anypoint Exchange. Revoking a contract blocks the client application from accessing the API. When you revoke a contract, you can either restore or delete the contract anytime. Before you delete a contract, you must first revoke it. 

To delete a contract with an application:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*.
. Click the name of the API instance for which you want to revoke access.
. Click the `<api version>:<api instance or label>` link, for example, `v1:16046365`. 
. Click *Contracts*.
. For the application for which you want to revoke access, click *Revoke*.
+
The *Restore* and *Delete* options appear.
. To delete the contract, click *Delete*.
