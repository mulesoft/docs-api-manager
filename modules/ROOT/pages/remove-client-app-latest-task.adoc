As the Organization Administrator of the master organization, you can revoke or delete a contract granting an application access to your API. When you revoke a contract, you can restore the contract at any time. 

Deleting a contract deletes the approved contract from Anypoint Exchange. Before you delete a contract, you must first revoke it. 

To delete a contract with an application:

. In API Manager, click *API Administration*.
. Click the name of the API instance for which you want to revoke access.
. Click the `<api version>:<api instance>` link, for example, `v1:16046365`. 
. From the configuration page for the API instance, click *Contracts* from the left menu.
. For the application for which you want to revoke access, click *Revoke*.
+
The *Restore* and *Delete* options appear:
