<plugin>
    <groupId>org.mule.tools.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${mule.maven.plugin.version}</version>

. From the command line in your project's folder, run the install phase:

It will also verify that all the necessary files were provided for the packaging, and that the information provided in the mule-artifact and in the policy yaml are valid.
