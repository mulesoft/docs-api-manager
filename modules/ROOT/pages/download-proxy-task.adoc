You use a proxy to manage your API without having to change its implementation and to prevent attacks on the server. Mule Runtime is the server that hosts a Mule proxy application.

NOTE: You must have View APIs Configuration permission to download a proxy.

You can download a proxy that you generated in API Manager by following this procedure.

. In Anypoint Platform, click *API Manager*.
. Click the API instance whose proxy you want to download.
. Click *Actions*
. Click *Download Proxy*.
// when Mule 4 is released, will this dialog list it, or will u download some other way?
