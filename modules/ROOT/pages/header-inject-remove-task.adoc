The Header Injection policy adds headers to the request/response of the message. The Header Removal policy removes all listed headers.

== Applying Header Injection Policy

To apply this policy to an API, specify an inbound/outbound map of the headers that you want to add in the message processing in the form of a key-value pair.

If the injected header already exists in the message attributes, the policy creates a new header, without overriding the value of the existing one. This action creates two headers with the same name.

*Note:* Comma separated values are not considered multiple values by the Mule HTTP Connector.

You can use DataWeave expressions to set a value. For example:

`“#[attributes.requestPath]”`

To overwrite the value of a header, remove it before injecting the header.


== Applying Header Removal Policy

To apply this policy to an API, specify the header names as regular expressions, separated by commas.

For example:

image::remove-inbound-header.png[]

image::remove-outbound-header.png[]


The content-type and content-length headers of a request can be filtered by this policy, as shown in this example, as well as the host header.

In the response, only the content-type header is removed.
