= Filtering Internal Mule HTTP Headers in Mule 3.x API Proxy
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]


To avoid internal Mule HTTP headers from being leaked to the backend implementation or from being included in the response, API proxies use the following filters by default:

* To avoid the internal Mule HTTP header from being leaked to the backend implementation:
+
`<custom-processor class="com.mulesoft.gateway.extension.ProxyRequestHeadersProcessor" />`
* To avoid the internal Mule HTTP header from being included in the response:
+
`<custom-processor class="com.mulesoft.gateway.extension.ProxyResponseHeadersProcessor" />`

Currently, there are no customizations available for these filters.
