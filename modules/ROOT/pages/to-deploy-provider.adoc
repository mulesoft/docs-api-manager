To use the access token to call an API managed by the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy, you first have to deploy the provider on a server. In this procedure, you deploy the provider to CloudHub. When you deploy the sample OAuth 2.0 provider, you set the client ID and client secret using *Settings* > *Properties* in Runtime Manager. Setting the client ID and client secret in Studio preferences does not suffice. The preferences are not synched with Runtime Manager property settings.

. In Studio, select *File* > *Export*.
+
The Select dialog appears.
+
. Expand the Mule directory, and select *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive*. Click Next.
+
The Export Mule Project dialog appears.
+
. Select the project, browse to a location for saving the archive, name the archive, select *Attach project sources*, and click *Finish*.
+
. In Anypoint Platform, in Runtime Manager, click *Deploy Application*.
+
The Deploy Application page appears.
+
. Configure the following settings:
+
* Application Name--Fill in an application name, for example auth-provider-testing.
* Deployment Target--Accept CloudHub as the deployment target.
* Application File--Choose the archive you exported from Studio.
* Runtime version--Select 3.8.0 or later for this example.
* Worker size--Select a worker size such as 0.1 vCores.
. On the *Properties* tab, add your client_id and client_secret. Use the following syntax, replacing the values shown in this example with your own `client_id` and `client_secret`:

+
CloudHub requires these credentials. The credentials you entered in Anypoint Studio preferences earlier do not suffice because these credentials are not transferred to CloudHub.
+
. Click *Deploy Application*.
