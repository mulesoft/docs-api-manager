:keywords: api, gateway, proxy, configuration

Mule 3.8.0 and later unifies the API Gateway runtime with the core Mule runtime. You can configure a Mule runtime or legacy API Gateway instance to use a network proxy for channeling its communication with the platform. The instance must be paired with an Anypoint Platform organization (or Business Group). Use the following procedure to configure an on-site API Gateway instance to use a proxy.

The only supported proxy authentication method in API Gateway runtime is Basic. NTLM is not supported.

In Studio, perform configure proxy access as described in this procedure:

. In Anypoint Studio, right-click the project name in the Package Explorer, select *Run As...* > *Run Configurations...*
. Select *Mule Application*, then open the *Arguments* tab.
. Copy and paste the following into the VM arguments box, leaving one space after any content that is already in the box:
+
`-Danypoint.platform.proxy_host=<IP address or host name of the proxy server> -Danypoint.platform.proxy_port=<port number of the proxy server (default value is 80)>` +
+

+
. Optionally, add a username and password for your proxy as follows:  +
+
`-Danypoint.platform.proxy_username=<username to use for authentication> -Danypoint.platform.proxy_password=<password to use for authentication>`


In Mule Runtime, perform the following command line changes to configure proxy access.

. Open the  `wrapper.conf` file in your `<MULE_HOME>/conf` folder.
+
<MULE_HOME> is the value of the MULE_HOME variable, usually the root directory of the Mule installation, such as `/opt/Mule/api-gateway-2.0.0/`
+
. Paste the following code as a new item at the end of the list in your file, replacing the value of **`n`** with the next incremental values over the previous entries in the list.
+
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_host=<IP address or host name of the proxy server>

wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_port=<port number of the proxy server (default value is 80)>
----
+
. Optionally, add a username and password for your proxy by pasting the following code as new items at the end of the list in your file, again replacing the value of **`n`** with the next incremental values over the previous entries in the list.
+
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_username=<username to use for authentication>

wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_password=<password to use for authentication>
