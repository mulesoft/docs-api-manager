API Manager 2.x enables you to use the secrets you stored in your secret group to build an HTTPS-based API for your CloudHub or hybrid deployments. 
By configuring a TLS context for your inbound and outbound traffic, you can ensure your traffic's security.

The secrets manager integration is only supported by API Proxies running Mule 4, and only for CloudHub, Hybrid, and standalone deployments.
Supported keystores for the TLS context are JCEKS, PKCS12, and JKS.

To build an HTTPS Proxy in Mule 3 or Runtime Fabric deployment target, see xref:mule-runtime::build-an-https-service.adoc[Build an HTTPS Service].

== Before You Begin

To configure your HTTPS API Proxy using secrets stored in your secret group, ensure you have:

* Requested the following permissions from your Anypoint Platform admin:
** Secrets Manager permissions +
To configure an existing TLS context for the API Proxy, you need the *Read secrets metadata* permission.
Review the xref:anypoint-security::asm-permission-concept.adoc[Secrets Manager Permissions] reference for more information.
** API Manager permissions +
To apply a TLS context to an API proxy in API Manager, you need the *Manage API Configuration* role.
See the xref:access-management::permissions-by-product.adoc#api-manager[API Manager] section of the Permissions
by Product page for more information.
* xref:anypoint-security::asm-secret-group-creation-task.adoc[Created a Secret Group] +
Enable the *Secret Group Downloadable* checkbox.
* xref:anypoint-security::asm-secret-group-creation-task.adoc#add-a-tls-context[Added a TLS Context] +
Set TLS context's target to *Mule*.

== Configure your API

include::partial$task-configure-proxy.adoc[tags=first-steps;target-type;mid-steps;asset-type-options;mid-steps2;raml-oas-version]

. Click *Add TLS Context* for *TLS Context for Outbound traffic*.
.. Select the secret group where you hosted your TLS Context from the *Secret Group* drop-down list.
.. Select your TLS Context for your HTTPS API Proxy from the *TLS Context* drop-down.
+
[NOTE]
If you can't see a context, check that you have the right permissions mentioned in the prerequisites above.

. Optionally, if you want to enable SSL for inbound traffic:
.. Select *HTTPS* for the *Scheme*. +
This makes the *TLS Context for Inbound Traffic* field appear.
.. Select *Add TLS Context*.
.. Select the secret group where you hosted your TLS Context from the *Secret Group* drop-down.
.. Select your TLS Context for your HTTPS API Proxy from the *TLS Context* drop-down.

== API Proxy Deployment

You can deploy your API proxy to CloudHub, hybrid, or standalone servers.

=== Deploy to CloudHub

After you configured your API Proxy and selected *CloudHub* as the *Proxy deployment target*, your API Proxy will be automatically deployed, with the secrets already configured.

Your secrets are configured as secure property placeholders under the `SecureProperties` in your `mule-artifact.json`. +
The amount of properties supplied depends on your selected configuration:

[source,sample,linenums]
----
inbound.keystore.keyPassword_281324
inbound.keystore.password_281324

inbound.truststore.password_281324

outbound.keystore.keyPassword_281324
outbound.keystore.password_281324

outbound.truststore.password_281324
----

The `281324` suffix in this case is API Instance ID of your API Proxy.

If you inspect your API Proxy's XML, you can see these properites being used in your trustore/keystore configurations:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<tls:trust-store path="outbound-truststore.jks" password="${outbound.truststore.password_281324}" type="JKS" insecure="true"  />
----

=== Deploy to Hybrid

After you configure your API Proxy and select *Hybrid* as the *Proxy deployment target*, your API Proxy will be automatically deployed, with the secrets already configured.

Your secrets are configured as secure property placeholders under the `SecureProperties` in your `mule-artifact.json`. 
+
The amount of properties supplied depends on your selected configuration:

[source,sample,linenums]
----
inbound.keystore.keyPassword_281324
inbound.keystore.password_281324

inbound.truststore.password_281324

outbound.keystore.keyPassword_281324
outbound.keystore.password_281324

outbound.truststore.password_281324
----

The `281324` suffix in this case is API Instance ID of your API Proxy.

If you inspect your API Proxy's XML, you can see these properties being used in your trustore/keystore configurations:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<tls:trust-store path="outbound-truststore.jks" password="${outbound.truststore.password_281324}" type="JKS" insecure="true"  />
----

=== Deploy to Standalone Servers

To deploy your API Proxy to a standalone server, you need to provide secured properties for each TLS Context.

. Download the API Proxy.
.. In API Manager, select the version of the API proxy you want to download.
.. Click the *Actions* button in the top-right corner of your screen and select *Download Proxy*.
. Take note of your API Instance ID under *API Instance*.
+
image::building-https-proxy-541ec.png[]
+
. When running your standalone Mule instance, you need to provide the keystore and key passphrases as -D arguments, along with your API Proxy's API Instance ID. +
For example, if your API instance ID is 15464957, you need to pass the arguments:
+
[source,sample,linenums]
----
./bin/mule \
-M-Dinbound.keystore.keyPassword_15464957=pass123 \
-M-Dinbound.keystore.password_15464957=pass123 \
-M-Dinbound.truststore.password_15464957=pass123 \
-M-Doutbound.keystore.keyPassword_15464957=pass123 \
-M-Doutbound.keystore.password_15464957=pass123 \
-M-Doutbound.truststore.password_15464957=pass123
