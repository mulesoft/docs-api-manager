= Build RAML or OAS API Proxies

API Manager 2.x enables you to use a RAML or OAS (version 2.0 only) type of API Proxy, for all your Mule 4 based proxies.

== Configuring your RAML or OAS API Proxy

. In API Manager, navigate to *Manage API* to create your API Instance. +
You can choose to either xref:manage-exchange-api-task.adoc[Creating an API instance by importing from Exchange] or xref:manage-exchange-api-task.adoc[Creating an API instance by importing on API Manager].
. In *Asset Type*, select *RAML/OAS*.
+
[Note] OAS 3.0 specifications are currently not supported in API Manager. You must convert the API to RAML or OAS 2.0 to manage using API Manager.
+
. To configure your API Proxy for this API instance you need to select *Endpoint with Proxy* in the *Managing Type* fields.
.. Select your *Proxy Deployment Target*  from the available deployment targets displayed.
.. Select the *Check this box if you are managing this API in Mule 4 or above* check mark.
.. Type in your *Implementation URI*.

. Click *Advanced Options*.
. In *Proxy Version*, select *latest*. +
This value ensures that your API proxy uses the latest released proxy version.
+
Versions 2.0.0 and later are the recommended version for OAS or RAML specs, since these versions add native OAS support. +
If you upload an OAS API specification to an API proxy version 1.0 or earlier, your API specification will be translated to RAML.
. Select your *Scheme* and *Port* number for your API proxy. +
Optionally, you can set up an *API Instance label* and a *Response Timeout*.
