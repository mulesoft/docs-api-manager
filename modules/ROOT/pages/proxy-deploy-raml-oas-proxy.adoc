= Building a RAML/OAS API Proxy

API Manager 2.x allows you to use a RAML/OAS type of API Proxy, for all your Mule 4 based proxies.

== Configuring your RAML/OAS API Proxy

. In API Manager, navigate to *Manage API* to create your API Instance. +
You can choose to either xref:manage-exchange-api-task.adoc[Creating an API instance by importing from Exchange] or xref:manage-exchange-api-task.adoc[Creating an API instance by importing on API Manager].
. In *Asset Type*, select *RAML/OAS*.
. To configure your API Proxy for this API instance you need to select *Endpoint with Proxy* in the *Managing Type* fields.
.. Select your *Proxy Deployment Target*  from the available deployment targets displayed.
.. Select the *Check this box if you are managing this API in Mule 4 or above* check mark.
.. Type in your *Implementation URI*.

. Click *Advanced Options*.
. In *Proxy Version*, select *v2.0 (Improved API specification parser)*.
+
[NOTE]
--
v2.0 is the recommended version for OAS/RAML specs, since native OAS is only supported by this version. +
If you upload a OAS spec to a v1.0 proxy, your API specification will be translated to RAML.
--
. Select your *Scheme* and *Port* number for your API proxy. +
Optionally, you can set up an *API Instance label* and a *Response Timeout*.
