You need one of the following installations to build a Mule OAuth provider:

* Mule 3.8.0 runtime or later
* API Gateway runtime 2.0 or earlier

To build the provider on API Gateway runtime 2.0 or earlier, download the Gateway Runtime 2.0 version of the External OAuth 2.0 server for Anypoint Platform from Exchange:

`+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange+`.

Use the following software:

* Anypoint Studio 6.x with Mule Runtime EE 3.8 or later
* Java JDK 1.8
* Maven 3.3.9

The Mule OAuth provider can run on any application server that is in the same organization as your OAuth-protected API. For example, you can run the Mule provider on premises using a Tomcat server or in the cloud using CloudHub.

To test the provider, you need tools that support `curl`.
