= Create API Groups and Add API Instances
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

You can bundle a set of APIs to enable ease-of-use and efficiency for your API consumers. To create a bundle, you first create an API Group and then add the relevant API instances to it. If you want your API Group to be discovered by consumers, you must publish it to Anypoint Exchange.

When you complete the task of creating an API Group with the help of this topic, you would have created an API Group, the very first version of that group, and the very first group instance. Additionally, you would also have added API instances to the API Group instance.

You can add API instances to the API Group instance based on the environment (Production, Sandbox, or others) in which you create the API Group instance. For example, if you created a API Group instance in Production environment, you can add API instances to the API Group instance only from Production.

You create API Groups using the following steps:

*Step 1:* <<create-api-groups,Create an API Group>>

The first step to creating an API Group that can be used by consumers, is create an API Group. 

*Step 2:* <<adding-api-instances-to-groups,Add API instances to the new API Group>>

After you create the API Group, you then add API instances to this group for the first time.

== Task Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have:

* At least one API instance in your organization or business group.
// +
// Otherwise, you may not find the required organization or business group in the list.
* API Group Administrator permissions to perform to create API Groups .
//Group administrators is a permission which is set a business group *BG) level. A group administrator can manage (create, update, delete) all groups of the BG. The permissions algo, gives user VIEW access to all API instances of the BG (so user can add them to the group)

. Click *Ok*.
+
The *Creating a new group* page is displayed. You are now ready to <<adding-api-instances-to-groups,add API instances>> to the API Group.

== Add API instances to API Groups

Your API Group is not complete and functional unless you add the API instances to the group that you want to bundle. When you add API instances to an API Group, you can add:

* Only those API instances that belong in the same business group or organizations.
* Only those API instances that belong the same environment as the API Group instance.
* Only those API instances that belong to the same identity provider (IdP) as the API Group instance. You cannot mix IdPs in an API Group instance.

To add a new API instance to a new API Group:

. On the *Creating a new group* page, select an environment from the *Select environment* drop-down list.
+
.The screen capture shows how to add API instance to an API Group.

+
<1> The organization under which the API Group is created.
<2> The Add button to add more API instances to the group.
<3> The Add Organization button to add organizations to the group.
<4> The Save button.
<5> The delete button to instantly delete an API instance from the group.
. From the *Select an API* list, choose the API instance that you want to add.
. From the *Select a version / instance* list, choose the version of the API Instance that you want to add to the Group.
. If you want to include additional API instances in the API Group, click *Add* and specify the details.
. If the API instance and the API Group belong in different business groups:
.. Click *Add Organization*.
.. Select the organization or business group in which your API instance is available.
.. From the environment, select the API instance, and version that you want to add.
. Click *Save*.
+
