As an Anypoint DataGraph administrator, you ensure that only authorized client applications can consume the unified schema by granting access based on specified user credentials and the SLA tier.

Client applications request access to the unified schema via Anypoint DataGraph. Approving access creates a contract between the client application and the unified schema for its environment, and registers the client application. Refer to xref:api-contracts-landing-page.adoc[Client Applications and Contracts] for more information.

== Anypoint DataGraph Contract Administration
