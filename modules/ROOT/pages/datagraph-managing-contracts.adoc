As an Anypoint DataGraph administrator, you can ensure that only authorized client applications can consume the unified schema. You grant access based on credentials and SLA tier.

Client applications request access to the unified schema via Anypoint DataGraph. Approving access creates a contract between the client application and the unified schema for its environment, and registers the client application. Refer to xref:api-contracts-landing-page.adoc[Client Applications and Contracts] for more information.

== Anypoint DataGraph Contract Administration

In API Manager, the DataGraph *Contracts* page lists client applications that have requested access, client applications you've approved, and client applications whose contracts you have revoked.
