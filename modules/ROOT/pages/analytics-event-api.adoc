API Manager gathers analytics data for each API you manage.  You can create charts that query and display event data. Using the Analytics Event API you can create reports that query raw event data and expose it through an API endpoint.

You can create reports that span multiple APIs, or create different reports for the same API. The Analytics Event API provides a one month retention policy for events and, with a data availability delay of up to 10 minutes.

The Analytics Event API enforces a usage limit of 10 requests/minute, with a maximum of 20,000 events per request. Request rates higher than 10 request/minutes will be throttled.

== To Create a Report

The following procedure describes how to create a report to find the API events that, for example, resulted in a policy violation. Suppose you want to find any events that were rejected because of policy violations, such as rate limiting or IP blacklisting. In step 5, you select Violated Policy Name in Fields to filter the data in this manner.

. In API Manager > Analytics > Manage Reports, click New to create a new report.
. In Create Report, select a data source, range, and format.
. In Fields, select Violated Policy Name.
+
A URL appears that you can use to see the report after you save it. The date that data becomes
available for the data source you specified appears.
+
. Save the report.
+
When the report becomes available, go to the URL to view it.

== Running a Report in the Browser

The following steps show you how to run a report. API Analytics lists the starting point for when data is available for the API, including a warning message if no data is available for the API.

On the *Manage Reports* page, click *Run* for the specified report.

After the report runs, the CSV or JSON file contains all of the raw analytics data for the parameters you specified in the report.

== Calling a Report Programmatically

The following steps describe how use curl to call the report's API endpoint and programmatically retrieve the analytics data. If you're using Windows, you can use PowerShell as an alternative to curl.

=== Use curl to View Report Information

You get the value of $TOKEN by running the curl command in this procedure. The command gets the access_token JSON property of this response.

The authorization header has the form: Authorization: `Bearer {$TOKEN.access_token}`

The use of the jq command-line JSON processor is one possible solution for obtaining the access token value. Download and install this application or one with the same functionality for this procedure.

To view report information programatically:

. Open a new terminal window and execute the following command:
+
----
TOKEN=$(curl -s https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -d "username=<YOUR-USERNAME>&password=<YOUR-PASSWORD>" | jq -r .access_token)
----
+
. This command sends a request to the authentication servers of the Anypoint Platform and, if the request is successful, returns an access token that's stored in the `$TOKEN` variable. The value of this variable is displayed below:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
 "access_token": "54545454-5454-5454-5454-545454545454",
 "token_type": "Bearer",
 "redirectUrl": "/accounts/#/cs/profile/home"
 }
----
+
. After the access token has been received, it must be appended to the `Authorization` header in the request to the Analytics Reporting API endpoint for your report. To make a request to this endpoint, copy it from the *Manage Reports* page in the Analytics dashboard. Using the `$TOKEN` variable from the previous step, include it in the next request as shown below:
+
[source,console]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics/1.0/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/events?format=csv&startDate=2016-01-01&endDate=2016-12-31&fields=Application%20Name.Client%20IP.Resource%20Path > output.csv"
----
+
. If the request is successful, the response includes a CSV file (as requested) that downloads as a file with the specified name (`output.csv)` in the directory where the `curl` request was made.

An example shell script combining the two curl commands and which displays values in the command prompt window is:

[source,text,linenums]
----
TOKEN=$(curl -s https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -d "username=myusername&password=mypassword" | jq -r .access_token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics/1.0/42424242-4242-4242-4242-424242424242/events?format=csv&startDate=2016-01-01&endDate=2016-11-10&fields=Application%20Name.Client%20IP.Resource%20Path"
echo;echo
----

Example output for this command is:

[source,text,linenums]
----
"Application Name","Client IP","Resource Path",Timestamp,"API ID","API Version ID","API Name","API Version Name"
"Las Vegas T-Shirt serviceLas Vegas T-Shirt serviceLas Vegas",83.178.96.0,/,2016-10-03T04:27:02.072Z,61460,63811,"test api contracts",1

|===

If the Content-Length header is present, the Response Size is set to that value. If the Content-Length header is not present and the payload is a String, Analytics calculates the length of the String and reports that value. If the Content-Length header is not present and the payload is not a String, Analytics reports the response size as -1. For example, if the output returned is a DataWeave stream and the Content-Length header is not present, Analytics doesn't report a response size because the value is not a String. However if your application performs a String conversion, the response size is listed.
