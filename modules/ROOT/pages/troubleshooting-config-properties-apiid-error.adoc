When you configure the API gateway for API autodiscovery, you might receive the following "failed to deploy artifact" error: 

=== Error Example
[source, text, linenums] 
----
org.mule.runtime.deployment.model.api.DeploymentException: Failed to deploy artifact [accounts]
Caused by: org.mule.runtime.api.exception.MuleRuntimeException: org.mule.runtime.deployment.model.api.DeploymentInitException: PropertyNotFoundException: Couldn't find configuration property 
value for key ${apiId} from properties provider Domain properties - within 
resolver Deployment properties trying to process key apiId - within 
esolver global-properties configuration attributes trying to process key apiId - within resolver environment properties provider trying to process key apiId - within resolver Deployment properties trying to process key apiId - within resolver External files trying to process key apiId - within resolver Deployment properties trying to process key apiId
----

== Cause
This issue occurs if you did not add the '
`apiId` property in the `config.properties` file, and failed to modify the value for the `apiId` attribute in the `api-gateway:autodiscovery` element. The Autodiscovery process runs on a specific instance of API Manager. For that reason, you must specify a valid `apiId` of type `long`.

If you deployed a proxy application through API Manager or downloaded the auto-generated proxy, this setting is automatically configured.


== Solution
To resolve this issue:

. Navigate to the config.properties file and append the following property and value pair: 
+
[source, text, linenums]
----
apiId=[your-specific-value]
----
+
. In your <api-gateway:autodiscovery> element, set the `apiID` attribute to the `apiId` property in the config.properties file:
+
[source, text, linenums]
----
apiId=${apiId}
----
