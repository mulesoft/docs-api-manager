. In *API Administration*, click **Add API** and select **Promote API from environment**.
. Select the **Source Environment**.
. Select the **API** by entering the name of the API into the search field.
. Select the **API Version**.
. Select the **API instance label**.
. Optionally, uncheck any of the **Include in Promotion** options you want to exclude.
. Click **Promote**.
. Review and update the Runtime & Endpoint Configuration details as needed and click **Save**.

== Import API from Zip File

== Notes

* Although OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.0 is supported, the callback feature is not. To work around this issue, either handle the callback outside of the Mule runtime engine domain or use an OAS 3.0 specification that does not use callbacks.
