:keywords: credential providers, external client providers

With Anypoint Platform, you can use multiple client providers, also known as identity providers (IdP) to manage client credentials to help you implement security policies and regulations. This ensures that client applications that are created to access APIs are stored in different systems based on the environment where API is located. Separate client providers helps with segregating client application management for:

* Different business groups
* Different environments, such as production, QA, and sandbox
* Internal and external APIs

For example, a “sandbox” client, whose credentials live in an external Okta IdP, can have contracts only with API instances in the organization “Sandbox A” environment of the business group A and “open” environment of business group B. Similarly, a “core-internal” client, whose credentials live in the private ADFS IdP of the organization, can have contracts only with API instances in the “prod” environment of the business group X. 


== How This Works

When you enable external IdPs, they act as authorization servers to issue access tokens to a client application for accessing an API. When you request access to a client application, the corresponding client ID and client secret credentials are created in the IdP specified in that API specification.

If an API has only applied the Client ID Enforcement policy and not applied the OAuth policy the client application is still created in an external IdP.
The API owner does not have access to the IdP configuration in API Manager. 

When an OAuth policy is deployed to API gateway, the platform automatically injects IdP configuration, such as the token URL and token introspection url in the policy configuration. The IdP configuration is completely hidden from a user in API Manager.

If no external IdPs are enabled, Access Manager acts as the default authorization server in that case. 
//[PA:-Tomas not sure what the following statement is trying to say.]
// Any client apps (clientID/clientSecret) that’re created for accessing an API are created and maintained within Anypoint.
// OOTB OAuth policies with an external IdP can’t be applied 
// ClientId enforcement policy can be applied.


== The Use Case

To better understand how to implement the multiple external credential provider feature, let us go back to our example of "Good Weather" company that is in the business of forecasting weather for a given location and time. Good Weather collects quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and, using meteorology, predicts how that current state will change over time.

Good Weather has several sub-organizations running under the master organization. These sub-organizations exist based on the functions they perform, for example, finance, HR, and R&D. The R&D department researches and collects recent meterological data from various sources. This data is then consumed by various client applications. 

Therefore, Good Weather needs to ensure that this data is accurate at all times. For that reason the weather APIs must be accessed only by employees of the R&D department. Good Weather also want to ensure that the production APIs and the single source of truth at all times.

On the other hand, the HR sub-organization wants to ensure that the employees in R&D do not have access to their payroll APIs. HR also wants to restrict access to their internal tax and payroll APIs.

To ensure security and segregation of access to these different organizations, environments, and APIs, Good Weather IT sets up a separate external IdP for each sub-organization and environments (production and non-production).


== Guidelines for Implementing Multiple Client Providers

Before you implement multiple client providers in your instance of Anypoint Platform, ensure that you carefully review the following guidelines and best practices:

* If you assign an external IdP to an environment, all existing APIs in that environment display Anypoint Platform in the UI dropdown. 
+
You can then reassign the required external IdP for that API.
* After you assign a external IdP to an API, you cannot change this IdP back to be the default of Anypoint Platform as a credential provider.
* If you remove an IdP from an environment, all existing APIs and client applications using that IdP will continue working.
* If you delete an IdP from a master organization, all existing APIs and client applications using that IdP will change to the default Anypoint Platform IdP. 
+
All contracts will remain intact.
* When changing the IdP for an existing API instance, ensure that:
** The API has no contracts
** The API has no IdP-related policies applied, such as PingFederate and OpenID policies.
* When promoting and importing an API:

== Configuring External Client Providers User Flow

Based on the use case explained in the previous section, Good Weather uses the following flow to implement multiple external IdPs:

image::multiple-IdP-user-flow.png[User Flow for Configuring Multiple External Client Providers]

To configure multiple external client providers:

* Step 1: From *Access Management*, first enable xref:access-management::conf-client-mgmt-pf-task.adoc[client management]. 
* Step 2: From *Access Management*, configure environments and business groups.
* Step 3: From *API Manager*, xref::create-instance-task.aodc[create or modify] APIs using the new IdPs. 
* Step 4: From *API Manager*, xref::automated-policies-landing-page.aodc[configure policies] associated to the new IdP.
