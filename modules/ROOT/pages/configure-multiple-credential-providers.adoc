:keywords: credential providers, external client providers

You can use multiple client providers, to help you enforce security and regulations in your business organization. These client providers, such as, OpenAM and PingFederate, enable you to secure your operational data, such as client credentials and access token. 

You can use an Anypoint Platform client provider (native client provider) or implement an external client provider. If you do not specify a client provider for your environment or business group, Anypoint Platform uses its native client provider by default.

To assign separate client providers for different organizations and environments, you must first enable clients applications to be authenticated using OAuth for the client providers that you want to implement in your organization.

When you use multiple client providers, you can use them to:

* Different business groups
* Different environments, such as production, QA, and sandbox
* Internal and external APIs

== How This Works

//Need help here

When you enable external client providers, they act as authorization servers to issue access tokens to a client application for accessing an API. When you request access to a client application, the corresponding client ID and client secret credentials are created in the IdP specified in that API specification.

If an API has only applied the Client ID Enforcement policy and not applied the OAuth policy, the client application is still created in an external IdP.
When an OAuth policy is deployed to API gateway, the platform automatically injects IdP configuration, such as the token URL and token introspection url in the policy configuration. The IdP configuration is completely hidden from a user in API Manager.

If no external IdPs are enabled, Access Manager acts as the default authorization server in that case. 
//[PA:-Tomas not sure what the following statement is trying to say.]
// OOTB OAuth policies with an external IdP can’t be applied 
// ClientId enforcement policy can be applied.


== The Use Case

To better understand how to implement the multiple external credential provider feature, let us look at the example of "Good Weather" company that is in the business of forecasting weather for a given location and time. Good Weather collects quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and, using meteorology, predicts how that current state will change over time.

Good Weather has several sub-organizations running under the master organization. These sub-organizations exist based on the functions they perform, for example, Engineering and Forecasting. The Forecasting department researches and collects recent meterological data from various sources. This data is then consumed by various client applications. While the Engineering department maintains the applications that host the forecasting research data.

Good Weather needs to ensure that the forecasting data is accurate at all times. For that reason the weather APIs must be accessed only by employees of the Forecasting sub-organization. Good Weather also wants to ensure that the production APIs are the single source of truth at all times.

To ensure security and segregation of access for these different organizations, environments, and APIs, Good Weather IT sets up a separate external client providers for the Forecasting sub-organization.

== Guidelines for Implementing Multiple Client Providers

Before you implement multiple client providers in Anypoint Platform, ensure that you carefully review the following guidelines and best practices:

* When changing the client provider for an existing API instance, ensure that the API:
** Has no contracts
** Has no client provider-related policies applied, such as PingFederate and OpenID policies.
* When promoting and importing an API:

* If you assign an external client provider to an environment, all existing APIs in that environment display Anypoint Platform in the UI by default. 
+
You must then reassign the appropriate external client provider for that API.
* After you assign an external client provider to an API, you cannot reassign the client provider back to the default native Anypoint Platform credential provider.
* If you remove a client provider from an environment, all existing APIs and client applications using that client provider continue to work.
* If you delete an client provider from a master organization, all existing APIs and client applications using that client provider default to the native Anypoint Platform client provider. 
+
All contracts remain intact.


== Configuring Multiple Client Providers User Flow

Based on the use case explained in the previous section, Good Weather uses the following flow to implement multiple external client providers:

=== Tasks for Implementing Multiple Client Providers Based on Roles

Based on your role in your organization and your requirements, you might need to perform the following set of tasks to implement multiple client providers:

[%header,cols="40a,15a,60a"]
|===
| Role | Task | Where to Perform | Notes
| Business Group Administrator | Assign multiple IdPs to an environment and also assign a default IdP. | Access Management | Using multiple IdPs provides flexibility to choose an IdP in API configuration inside API Manager, which can be useful when multiple teams are using the same environment for building APIs, but still want to use separate IdPs. This also helps in use cases when separate API instances are created for internal and external consumers, and separate IdPs based on a consumer is required. 
| Business Group Administrator | Be notified about any possible interruption to API consumers when I am about to change any IdP configuration.  | Access Management |
| Master organization Administrator | Change the default IdP across all environments and across all business groups. | Access Management | Resetting the default IDP updates all environments across all business groups to a selected IDP, without affecting existing client applications. This way, when a new IdP is created for the organization, all environments are updated with just one change.
| API Manager Administrator | Review which client provider an application belongs to on the client administrator page to be able to differentiate between different applications with the same name. | Access Management |
| API Owner | Configure my API in API Manager to automatically map to a default IdP configured by the business group administrator. I can also select a different IdP, if available | API Manager | 
| API Owner | When promoting or importing an API between environments, specify an IdP from the target environment. | API Manager | If there is just one (default) IdP specified for the target environment, it is automatically assigned to the API on promotion. 
| Application User | Request access to an API based on the API instance that exists in a specific environment. | Exchange | When you select the API for which you want to request access, you must first choose the API instance to which you are requesting access. The API instance is filtered based on the environment.

=== Configure Multiple Client Providers

To configure multiple external client providers:

* Step 1: From *Access Management*, first enable xref:access-management::managing-api-clients.adoc[client management].
+
As an Anypoint Administrator, you must first enable clients applications to be authenticated using OAuth for the client providers that you want to implement in your organization.
* Step 2: From *Access Management*, xref:access-management::environments.adoc#add-an-idp-to-an-existing-environment[assign client providers] to environments and business groups.
+
As a Business Administrator, you must then configure multiple client providers and assign them to specific business organizations and environments.
* Step 3: From *API Manager*, xref::create-instance-task.adoc[create or modify] APIs using the new IdPs.
+
As an API Owner, you can create an API, import an API from Exchange or modify an API in API Manager. Optionally, you can promote an API from one environment to another, and import or export an API, as described in the user flow diagram in the previous section. 
* Step 4: From *API Manager*, xref::automated-policies-landing-page.aodc[configure policies] associated to the new IdP.
+
As an API Manager Administrator, you can apply policies to an API based on the client provider associated to it.
* Step 5: Optionally, from *Exchange*, xref:exchange::to-request-access[request access] to an API instance within a specific environment for business organization.
+
As an API consumer, you can request access to an API instance from registered client applications using private exchange or public portals.
