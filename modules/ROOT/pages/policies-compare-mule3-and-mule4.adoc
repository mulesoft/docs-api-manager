| Default expression language    | Uses MEL expressions | Uses DataWeave 2.0 
| Resources | External dependencies, such as libraries or resources cannot be included in the policy and must be available in the runtime | Policies can package resources, eliminating the dependency with the runtime. 
| Performance | Partial non-blocking processing | Full non-blocking processing  
| Versioning | Not supported | Fully supported and enforced 
| Execution order | Throttling, Rate Limiting, and CORS executed first. Other policies can be reordered | All policies, except CORS, can be reordered 
| Resource-level support | Restricted to RAML-based APIs | Support extended to HTTP-based APIs and RAML-based APIs 
| Class loader isolation  | Not supported | Supported between application libraries, extensions, and runtime libraries 
| Policy addition | Throttling | Spike Control
| Authentication support | HTTP Basic Authentication based on the Simple Security Manager or LDAP Security Manager policies | Simple Basic Authentication and LDAP Basic Authentication policies, including Security Manager configuration
| Rate Limiting support | Non-configurable quota shared between nodes and configured clusters. | * Configurable quota, including:
** Ability to expose headers 
** Ability to clusterize the quota 
| Configuration | Header propagation occurs by default  | Header propagation does not occur by default, but can be configured for Token Enforcement, Rate Limiting, and other default policies
| Customization | Support to build custom policy templates based on XML schema language | * Powerful engine for building custom policies, using the XML schema language
* Improved error handling
* Support for all MuleSoft components
* Isolation between policies and application
* Can be applied to outbound requests, coming back from the backend services
* Can package additional libraries 
* Versioning support provided for policies when uploaded to Exchange. 
//Isn't this the sum total of all the improvements. Do we need to list it here again? Eva??
