//tag::intro1[]
After you have created an API using Design Center or any other application, you can then manage that API in API Manager by adding an API instance. API instances remain under management until you delete them.

//end::intro1[]

//tag::flex-intro[]
Use Flex Gateway for any APIs that need a flexible and performant API gateway
that works with distributed and microservices environments and fits into your CI/CD environments.

//end::flex-intro[]

//tag::mule-intro[]
Use Mule Gateway if you have APIs on Mule Runtime that need an API gateway to manage, observe,
and secure your APIs.

//end::mule-intro[]

//tag::service-mesh-intro[]
Use Service Mesh to extend Anypoint Platform API Management capabilities to your
Istio service mesh through the deployment of a Mule Adapter.

//end::service-mesh-intro[]

//tag::intro2[]

There are three options for adding an API instance:

* <<add-api, *Add a new API:*>> Select this option to add a completely new instance of an API.
* <<promote-api, *Promote API from environment:*>> Select this option if you have an API instance in a different environment, for instance
the sandbox environment, and you want to promote it to the current or production environment.
* <<import-api, *Import API from zip file:*>> Select this option if you have exported an API instance from a different Anypoint Platform
instance.

When you are promoting or importing an API instance, you do not have options to alter the configuration. However, when you add a new API instance, you need to the downstream and the upstream configuration settings.

The following diagram shows the relationship of the upstream and downstream configurations settings to your upstream service and the downstream consumer application. In this configuration, the downstream service is the service making API requests that are completed by the upstream service. These terms represent the direction of dependency, not the direction of information. A downstream service could make a `POST` request where it provides information to the upstream service. However, the downstream service is still dependent on the upstream service to complete the request.

// Steps

// First steps for all Mule proxies
//tag::proxy-first-steps[]
. Navigate to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*. 
. In *API Administration*, click *Add API* and select *Add new API*.
. Select *Mule Gateway* as your runtime.
. Select *Deploy a proxy application* for *Proxy type*.
//end::proxy-first-steps[]

// All target types for Mule apps and proxies
//tag::target-type[]
. Select the *Target type* from the following options:
+
* *CloudHub 2.0*: Select this option if you want to use the Mule runtime hosted by MuleSoft in a container-based cloud infrastructure. The
CloudHub 2.0 proxy includes a CPU with 0.1 vCores by default.
.. Select the **Runtime version**.
.. Enter a **Proxy app name**.
+
[NOTE]
--
When deploying an API directly to CloudHub 2.0, you cannot choose the region where the API is deployed. If you have a private space, your API is deployed to your private space. Otherwise, your API is deployed to the shared space in your default region. If you have multiple private spaces, a private space is chosen for you. Private spaces in your default region are chosen first. To learn more about spaces, see xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-shared-space-about.adoc[] and xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-private-space-about.adoc[].
--
* *CloudHub*: Select this option if you want to use the Mule runtime hosted on the cloud by MuleSoft. The
CloudHub proxy includes a CPU with 0.1 vCores and a memory of 500 MB, by default.
.. Select the **Runtime version**.
.. Enter a **Proxy app name**.
* *Hybrid:* Select Hybrid if you have a Mule runtime running on an on-premises server that you want to use.
See xref:runtime-manager::servers-create.adoc[Register a server in Runtime Manager] for more information.
+
[NOTE]
--
If you are running an API with a self-managed server, use the xref:manage-exchange-api-task.adoc[classic API creation flows]
to manage your API.
--
+
.. Select a target from the list or click **Add server**.
.. Enter a *Proxy app name*.

* **Runtime Fabric:** Select Runtime Fabric if you want to deploy API Proxies to a Mule runtime engine that is managed on Runtime Fabric.
See xref:runtime-fabric::proxy-deploy-runtime-fabric.adoc[Deploying API Proxies to Runtime Fabric] for more information.
.. Select a target from the list.
.. Select the **Runtime version**.
.. Enter a *Proxy app name*.
//end::target-type[]

// Only the hybrid type proxy
//tag::hybrid[]
. Select *Hybrid* for *Proxy deployment target*, then select the target server.
. Click *Next*.

// Select api steps
//tag::mid-steps[]
. Select an API from the following options:
* Click **Select API from Exchange** if you have an API shared with you through Exchange that you want to manage.

.. Click the API from the list under **Select API**. You can search for a specific API if needed.
.. Update the Asset type, API version, and Asset version if needed.

* Click **Create new API**:
[arabic]
.. Enter a name for the new API asset.
//end::mid-steps[]

// Assets type options for flex because flex does not support soap APIs

.. Select the **Asset type** from the following options:

** **REST API:** Select this option if you have a RAML or OAS API definition file you want to include for your asset.
+
Upload either a RAML or OAS file for your REST API. Versions 2.0.0 and later are the recommended versions for OAS or RAML specs, because these versions add native OAS support. If you upload an OAS API specification to an API proxy version 1.0 or earlier, your API specification is translated to RAML.
** **HTTP API:** Select this option if you do not have an API definition file you want to include for your asset.

.. Optionally, you can add an **AssetId** and customize the **Version** or **API Version** details by clicking **Advanced**.
. Click *Next*.

** **SOAP API:** Select this option if you have a WSDL API definition file or an external link to the file.
+
Upload a WSDL file for your SOAP API or add the link to the file. +

NOTE: Anypoint API Manager supports OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.0, with the exception of the callback feature. To work around this issue, handle the callback outside of the Mule runtime engine domain or use an OAS 3.0 specification that does not use callbacks.
