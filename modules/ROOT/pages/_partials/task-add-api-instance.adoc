After you have created an API using Design Center or any other application, you can then manage that API in API Manager by adding an API instance. API instances remain under management until you delete them.

//tag::flex-intro[]
Use Flex Gateway for any APIs that need a flexible and performant API gateway
that works with distributed and microservices environments and fits into your CI/CD environments.

//end::flex-intro[]

//tag::mule-intro[]
Use Mule Gateway if you have APIs on Mule Runtime that need an API gateway to manage, observe,
and secure your APIs.

//end::mule-intro[]

//tag::service-mesh-intro[]
Use Service Mesh to extend Anypoint Platform API Management capabilities to your
Istio service mesh through the deployment of a Mule Adapter.

There are three options for adding an API instance:

* <<add-api, *Add a new API:*>> Select this option to add a completely new instance of an API.
* <<promote-api, *Promote API from environment:*>> Select this option if you have an API instance in a different environment, for instance
the sandbox environment, and you want to promote it to the current or production environment.
* <<import-api, *Import API from zip file:*>> Select this option if you have exported an API instance from a different Anypoint Platform
instance.

When you are promoting or importing an API instance, you do not have options to alter the configuration. However, when you add a new API instance, you need to the downstream and the upstream configuration settings.

The following diagram shows the relationship of the upstream and downstream configurations settings to your upstream service and the downstream consumer application. In this configuration, the downstream service is the service making API requests that are completed by the upstream service. These terms represent the direction of dependency, not the direction of information. A downstream service could make a `POST` request where it provides information to the upstream service. However, the downstream service is still dependent on the upstream service to complete the request.
