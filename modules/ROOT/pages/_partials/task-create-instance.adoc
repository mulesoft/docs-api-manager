After you have created an API using Design Center or any other application, you can then manage that API in API Manager by adding an API instance.

There are three options for adding an API instance:

* *Add a new API:* Select this option to add a completely new instance of an API.
* *Promote API from environment:* Select this option if you have an API instance in a different environment, for instance
the sandbox environment, and you want to promote it to the current or production environment.
* *Import API from zip file:* Select this option if you have exported an API instance from a different Anypoint Platform
instance.

When you are promoting or importing an API instance, you do not have options to alter the configuration. However,
when you add a new API instance, you need to xref:configure-api-task.adoc[configure the endpoint] as well as other settings.
