Enable HTTPS in your Mule 3.x API proxies to enhance the privacy and protection of your APIs. HTTPS ensures that a client is communicating with the real API and receiving back authentic contents.

To enable your proxy application to support HTTPS requests:

. From API Manager, xref:download-proxy-task.adoc[download] and xref:proxy-latest-concept.adoc[deploy] an API proxy.
. From Anypoint Studio, add a xref:mule-runtime::tls-configuration.adoc#use-anypoint-studio-to-configure-tls[keystore (SSL certificate)] to your API proxy (API gateway).
. xref:studio::import-export-packages.adoc[Export] the modified proxy.
. In Runtime Manager, search for your proxy application. 
. From *Settings*, select *Upload File* in the *Choose File* menu and select your modified proxy.
