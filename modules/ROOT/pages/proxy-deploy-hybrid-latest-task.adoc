In API Manager, follow this procedure to deploy a proxy to hybrid if you use Mule Runtime 3.8 or later, API Gateway 2.x or later, or Mule 4.x.

To perform this procedure you need to meet the following prerequisites:

// what permissions do  you need?

* Completion of API configuration.
* Access to a Mule Runtime that has been configured to pair with your organization in the case of a private server.
* Registration of your private server with Mule Agent compatible with your Mule Runtime to deploy the API to a hybrid target:
** For Mule 3.8, use Mule Agent 1.9.0
** For Mule 4.x, use the Mule Agent specified in the release notes.
