You can manage your API from API Manager to apply policies, add contracts, alerts, and SLA tiers. Additionally, you can configure a proxy for your API that runs in CloudHub. You can manage your API using the following steps:

. <<create_an_api, Create an API in Exchange.>>
. <<import-api-to-API-Manager, Import your API to API Manager.>>
. <<configure_and_deploy_to_cloudhub, Configure a proxy for your API and deploy to CloudHub.>>

[[create_an_api]]
== Create an API Asset in Exchange

To manage an API in API Manager, you must first create your API asset in Anypoint Exchange.

To create an API in Exchange:

. Log into Anypoint Platform and select Anypoint Exchange.
. Click in `New Asset` button
+

+
. In the `Publish New Asset` view, choose the asset type and an asset name. 
+
For RAML, OAS, or WSDL asset types, you must also provide the corresponding associated file.
+

+
. Click `Publish button`.

[[import-api-to-API-Manager]]
== Import your API to API Manager

After you create the API in Exchange, you import the API to API Manager.

To import your API to API Manager:

. Log into Anypoint Platform and select API Manager.
+
The API Administration window is displayed.
. Select *Manage API > Manage API from Exchange*.
//image::getting-started-proxy-manage-api-from-exchange.png[Manage API from Exchange]
. On the Manage API from Exchange window, specify the following details:
+
- *API Name*: Type the first characters of the API name (The same name you chose when you created your asset in Exchange), and
then API Manager displays APIs to choose from. Select the API one that was recently created in Exchange.
+
- *Asset Type*: For this example we are going to use HTTP, but you can also choose to create a RAML/OAS or WSDL API.
+
- *API Version*: Available versions in Exchange.
+
- *Managing Type*: You may choose between `Basic Endpoint` or `Endpoint with Proxy`. Here we are using the endpoint with proxy.
+
- *Mule version:* If you are managing an API for Mule 4 or later, select this checkbox. 
+
In this example, we are creating the API for Mule 4.
+
- *Implementation URI*: Enter the URL where the API implementation resides. 
+
For this example we are using http://my-implementation.company.com:
+

+
----
For additional configuration options, click in *Advanced options*, and fill in the details.
----
+
. Click on `Save`.

The API settings view is displayed with the details of the imported API. Your API instance is now created:

[[configure_and_deploy_to_cloudhub]]
== Configure a Proxy and Deploy to Cloudhub

Deploying an API proxy to CloudHub enables you to protect your API implementation without having to worry about the infrastructure details, such as firewalls, and so on. 

To configure and deploy the proxy:

. In the API Settings view of API Manager, ensure that your `Proxy deployment target` configuration is set to `CloudHub`.
//*where is this displayed*--Fede
. Scroll down to `Deployment Configuration`:
+
image::getting-started-proxy-deployment-config.png[]
+
. From `Runtime Version`, select the runtime version you need, and set a name for your application
. Finally, click on `deploy`.

The following message is displayed: 

image::getting-started-proxy-success-deployment.png[width=66%]

Your API proxy is now successfully running in a CloudHub instance.
