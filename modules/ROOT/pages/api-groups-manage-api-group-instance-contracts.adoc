After you grant access to API Group instances in Exchange, a contract is automatically created between an application and the API instance. You can then manage that contract from API Manager.

== Applied Contracts

With API Groups, an application can have multiple contracts with the same API in these scenarios:
*  An application requests access to an API, and the request is approved. In this case, a direct contract is created between the application and the API. This is known as _API instance contracts_.
* An application requests access to an API Group instance, which has an API instance with which the application already has a direct contract. This is known as _API Group instance contracts_.

When an application has multiple contracts with the same API instance, only one contract is active at any given time. This is known as _Applied contracts_.

.The screen capture displays the contract levels and the contract status for the API instance contracts.

An application can have multiple contracts with the different APIs in an API Group. You can view the the API instance contracts at the API Group-level. The contracts are sorted by the applications that are in contract with the API Group. The contract that is currently active within an API Group is displayed as `Applied`.

When an application has multiple contracts with the same API, the least restrictive tier compared with other contract tiers of the same API is set to `Applied`. Only A contract can be set to Applied status only the contract is first approved. Because a revoked contract is no longer active, it cannot be set as `Applied`.

== Applied Contracts Example

To better understand how a contract is set to Applied if there are multiple contracts between an API and an application, let us look at the following example.

Good Weather requests access to API `Facebook` for an application named `Contacts`. A contract is created between `Contacts` and `Facebook`. Now, the consumer uses the same application `Contacts` to request access to an API Group instance named `Social Chatter` which consists of the `Facebook` API among others. A contract is created between `Contacts` and `Social Chatter`.

In this scenario, the application `Contacts` has two contracts:

* One directly to API `Facebook`
* One indirectly with API `Facebook` because of the contract with API Group instance `Social Chatter`

Since `Contacts` has two contracts, now the question is which contract will be set to `Applied`. Let us say that the:

* API contract tier: 100 requests per minute
* API Group contract: 10 requests per minute

In this scenario, the API contract will be set to `Applied` because it is the least restrictive tier. The user gets 90 requests more per minute than the API Group contract.

Note that a contract is applied for an API, and not for an API Group instance. For example, if the consumer creates a contract between the API Group instance `Social Chatter` and another application `Interests`:

* For `Contacts` and API `Facebook`, the applied contract will be the API contract.
* For `Interests` and API `Facebook`, the applied contract will be the API Group instance contract because it is the only contract between the application and the API. 
+
`Interests` does not have a direct contract with the `Facebook` API.

To view API Group instance contracts:

. In *API Manager*, click *API Groups*.
. From the API Group instance details page, click the `version:instance` link for the API Group instance.
. From the left navigation, click *Contracts* and expand the instance for which you want to view the contract information:
