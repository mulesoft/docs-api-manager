You can add, delete, and deprecate API versions, also known as _Exchange assets_, in Anypoint Exchange (Exchange). An API version in Exchange can have its own RAML file, API portal, and URL. See xref:exchange::manage-versions.adoc[Manage Versions] for more information.

If you configure new version details for an existing API and publish them to exchange, the new API asset version resides in Exchange and not in API Manager. However, you create the instances of the API and manage their versions in API Manager. If you publish a new API asset version for an existing API instance to Exchange, you must change the version of your API instance in API Manager if you want the instance to reflect the latest version.

To change the asset version of an API instance:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*.
. In *API Administration*, click the name of the API whose version you want to manage.

The API *Settings* detail appears:

. Select *Actions* > *Change API specification*.
. In *Asset version*, Select *latest*. 
. Click *Change*.
