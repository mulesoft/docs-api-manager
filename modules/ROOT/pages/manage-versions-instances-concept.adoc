= Managing API Versions

After you create an API in Anypoint Platform, you configure the version details for the API and then publish it to Anypoint Exchange (Exchange). The API version resides in Exchange, and not in API Manager. However, you manage this API version from API Manager. 

After setting up an API version for management, you repeat the process to create another instance. Attempting to configure the same version creates another instance of the version. You can create multiple instances and expand the version information to view details about them.

You can add, delete, and deprecate API versions, also known as _Exchange assets_, in Exchange. An API version in Exchange can have its own RAML file, API portal, and URL. See xref:exchange::manage-versions.adoc[Manage Versions] for more information.

To manage the version of an API instance:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*.
. In *API Administration*, click the name of the API whose version you want to manage.

The API *Settings* detail appears:

. Select *Actions* > *Change API specification*.
. In *Asset version*, Select latest. 
. Click *Change*.
