After an API is created, you can configure version details for the API and publish them to Anypoint Exchange (Exchange). The API asset version resides in Exchange, and not in API Manager. However, you manage the version of an API instance from API Manager. You can create multiple instances and expand the version information to view details about them.

To manage the version of an API instance:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*.
. In *API Administration*, click the name of the API whose version you want to manage.
+
The API *Settings* detail appears:

. Select *Actions* > *Change API specification*.
. In *Asset version*, Select latest. 
. Click *Change*.

You can add, delete, and deprecate API versions, also known as _Exchange assets_, in Exchange. An API version in Exchange can have its own RAML file, API portal, and URL. See xref:exchange::manage-versions.adoc[Manage Versions] for more information.
