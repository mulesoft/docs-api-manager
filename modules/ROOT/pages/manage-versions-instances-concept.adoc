After you publish new version details for an API definition to Exchange, you must update the *Asset version* of your deployed API instances in API Manager to reflect the changes.

For more information about versions in Exchange, see xref:exchange::asset-versions.adoc[].

To change the asset version of an API instance:

. Navigate to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*. 
. In *API Administration*, click the name of the API instance for which you want to change the version.
. Select *Actions* > *Change API specification*.
. In *Asset version*, select your desired version. 
. Click *Change*.
