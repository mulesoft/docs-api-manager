You can configure version details for an existing API and publish them to Anypoint Exchange (Exchange). The API asset version resides in Exchange, and not in API Manager. However, you can create multiple instances of an API and manage their version from API Manager. See xref:create-instance-task.adoc[Adding an API Instance], for information on how to add an API instance to API Manager.

To change the asset version of an API instance:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*.
. In *API Administration*, click the name of the API whose version you want to manage.
+
The API *Settings* detail appears:

. Select *Actions* > *Change API specification*.
. In *Asset version*, Select latest. 
. Click *Change*.

You can add, delete, and deprecate API versions, also known as _Exchange assets_, in Exchange. An API version in Exchange can have its own RAML file, API portal, and URL. See xref:exchange::manage-versions.adoc[Manage Versions] for more information.
