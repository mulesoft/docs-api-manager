To test the remote provider, use the same curl command that you used for testing the provider you ran locally, except change localhost:8082 to the CloudHub URL `+https://auth-provider-testing.cloudhub.io+` for the provider, and of course, substitute your own base64-encoded credentials for `NmJl...RDYK1`.

To test the provider, Windows users need to download tools that support `curl`.

----
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "Authorization: Basic NmJl...RDYK" -d 'grant_type=password&username=max&password=mule' 'https://auth-provider-testing.cloudhub.io/external/access_token' -k
----

The output includes the access token and the expiration time in seconds:

----
{"access_token":"Y9sxvtAc7ytI_yioGAoKhaqOJeEmrnZxgwXhNxYoTJ81WV2OqsLz1DvoT2Kj8Mu4NNZhc9PjBADPSiwumd1tPw","refresh_token":"GNTYxSh8gkHPCVqJYzyQFPyqssypq8aFKIQ_N9UxqfOv271YBsPP_vhpfJck2WZ7fnrVG1IrtSsarf0MBv657g","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":1800}
