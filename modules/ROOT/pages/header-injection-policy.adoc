|===

The Header Injection policy adds HTTP headers to the request or response of a message. When you configure this policy for your API, you must specify an inbound and outbound map of the headers that you want to add in the message processing in the form of a key-value pair:

image::header-inject-remove-diagram.png[]

You can optionally include DataWeave expressions for Mule 4.0 and Mule runtime engine (Mule) expressions for Mule 3.0 and in the value of the header:

`“#[attributes.requestPath]”`

In this example, all the headers matching the configured expression are injected to the message.


== How This Policy Works

If the injected header already exists in the message attributes, the policy creates a new header without overriding the value of the existing one. This action creates two headers with the same name:

.Inbound Header
image::inbound-header-map.png[]
+
.Outbound Header
image::outbound-header-map.png[]


To overwrite an existing message header, xref::header-removal-policy.adoc[remove] the existing header before you add your header.

== Configuring Policy Parameters

To create your Header Injection policy, configure the following parameters:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
| *Parameter* | *Description* 
|Inbound Header Map  | List of header names or regular expressions (comma-separated) to be injected at the beginning of the message processing, for example, `host, content.*`
|Outbound Header Map | List of header names or regular expressions (comma-separated) to be injected at the end of the message processing, for example, `content-type`
|Method & Resource conditions |The option to add configurations to only a select few or all methods and resources of the API
|===

[NOTE]
====
Comma-separated values are not considered multiple values by the Mule HTTP Connector.
