= Message Logging Policy
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

This policy logs a custom message with the information available between policies, proxy, or backend at any point of the execution. This policy works with both log4j and log4j2.

== Prerequisites

You need to have the Anypoint Platform organization administrator role or have permission to create or manage APIs.

== About Logging Policy Parameters

The Message Logging Policy consists of these configuration parameters:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Message |A DataWeave expression that's transformed into a message to be logged.

Note: If the payload is used as part of the message log, do not configure the Listener as non-repeatable (by default this setting is off).
|Conditional |The condition expressed as a DataWeave expression that returns true or false that needs to be satisfied to log the message. This field is optional.
|Category |The category that the log has. This parameter is optional. If no category is set, the default is the `org.mule.runtime.logging.policy-<policy id>` value.
|Level |Defines if the message is logged according to the configuration in your log4j2 file.
|Before Calling API |Set to cause your logging policy to be applied before the API is called.
|After Calling API |Set to cause your logging policy to be applied after the API is called.
|===

== About the Logging Format

A log has the following format: `<date> <thread name> <level> <category>: <message>`

category org.mule and message #[payload] (where payload value is "the payload") is:

`2018-01-25 18:57:29,907 [WrapperListener_start_runner] INFO org.mule: the payload`


== About Policy Implementation

Logging a policy consists of the following sequence:

. A request is sent to the API.
. The message is logged, if the following are true:
+
** The level and category of the log defined in the policy are included in the logger defined in the log4j2.xml configuration file.
** The conditional field of the policy was not set, or was set, and the condition was satisfied.
. The API response is returned. Message Logging Policy does not interfere with the execution of any policy nor its flow.
. The message appears in the application log.

== About Logging States

Before logging an API flow:

After logging an API flow:

Error handler after API flow:

== Logging Policy in XML

The following flow shows an example logging policy:
