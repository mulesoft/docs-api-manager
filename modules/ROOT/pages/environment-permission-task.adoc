To be able to fully access API Manager operations within an environment, users must have the API Manager Environment Administrator permission. An API Manager environment administrator role is associated to tasks performed only in API Manager. You can change permissions for API Manager-related operations from Anypoint Access Management.

Regarding roles, note that:

* Roles and permissions assigned to a user in one particular business group are independent of the roles and permissions assigned to that same user in other business groups. 
* Roles are business group specific, so ensure that you are in the correct business group for which to manage roles by clicking the menu next to your username on the top-right of the screen.

The following diagram explains the tasks covered by each permission:

In the above diagram, an Environment Administrator has access to all the functionalities and permissions.
Outer permissions provide permission to the inner permissions. For example, Manage Alerts gives permission to View Alerts and to View API Configuration.

API Manager supports the following additional environment-level permissions:

Hybrid access. This role enables deployment access from the API Manager, but cannot
guarantee that deployment is successful due to its dependency on Runtime Manager or Hybrid.

| Manage APIs Configuration | Import APIs from Exchange | This permission also
enables a user to promote an API to another environment, edit the configuration of an API, and delete
APIs.
