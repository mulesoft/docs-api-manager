A permission called API Manager Environment Administrator gives users full access to API Manager operations inside environments. API Manager environment administrator only relates to actions inside of API Manager.

To change permissions, you need access to the Access Management feature of Anypoint Platform.

API Manager also supports additional environment granular permissions:

* *Deploy API Proxies* - Deploy or redeploy an API proxy - Requires Runtime Manager and
Hybrid access. This role enables deployment access from the API Manager, but cannot
guarantee that deployment is successful due to its dependency on Runtime Manager or Hybrid.
* *Manage Alerts* - Create, edit, and delete alerts.
* *Manage APIs Configuration* - Import APIs from Exchange. This permission also
lets a user promote an API to another environment, edit the configuration of an API, and delete
APIs.
+
[NOTE]
--
This permission is per environment. API visibility can’t be restricted to specific users inside your Organization
--
* *Manage Contracts* - Deploy, reject, and revoke contracts. This permission also gives the user permission over tiers.
* *Manage Policies* - Create, edit, delete, enable, and disable a policy. Also lets a user edit the order of policies.
* *View Alerts* - List alerts and view configuration summary of an alert.
* *View APIs Configuration* - List APIs, view configuration summary of an API, and download proxies.

[NOTE]
--
This permission is per environment. API visibility can’t be restricted to specific users inside your Organization
--
* *View Contracts* - List contracts and their configuration. Can also list SLA tiers and their configuration.
* *View Policies* - View a listing of policies and view the configuration of a policy.

These permissions are for an environment, not for an API, and only relate to actions inside API Manager.

The relationships of the permissions are as follows:

An Environment Administrator has access to all functionality and permissions.
For others, outer permissions provide permission to the inner permissions.
For example, Manage Alerts gives permission to View Alerts and to View API Configuration.
