By default, a policy applies to the entire API. 

== Task Prerequisites

Before you apply a default policy, ensure that:

* Mule runtime engine (Mule) is installed with xref:api-gateway-capabilities-mule4.adoc[API gateway capabilities] enabled.
* An xref:api-instance-landing-page.adoc[API], configured with a basic endpoint or a proxy endpoint, exists in API Manager.
* A Mule application is deployed with a xref::connectors:http/http-listener-ref.adoc[HTTP(s) based flow], which is linked to the API through Autodiscovery, also known as tracked flow.

Autogenerated proxies handle these prerequisites in most cases. API gateway then reconciles the automated policies applied to an API in API Manager during runtime.

== Apply a Policy

To apply a policy:

* Go to *API Manager > API Administration* and select the API instance from the details window.
* From the left navigation, select *Policies > Apply New Policy*.
