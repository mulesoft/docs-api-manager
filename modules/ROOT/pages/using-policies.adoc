You can apply a policy either to the entire API (default) or to specific methods and resources of an API. 

== Prerequisites

Before you apply a default policy, ensure that:

* Mule runtime engine (Mule) is installed with xref:api-gateway-capabilities-mule4.adoc[API gateway capabilities] enabled.
* API Manager contains an xref:api-instance-landing-page.adoc[API] configured with a basic endpoint or a proxy endpoint.
* A Mule application is deployed with an xref:connectors::http/http-listener-ref.adoc[HTTP-based or HTTPS-based flow] that is linked to the API through autodiscovery.
+
When autodiscovery is correctly configured in your Mule application, your applicationâ€™s API is tracked by or paired to API Manager.

Autogenerated proxies follow these prerequisites in most cases. The API gateway then reconciles the automated policies applied to an API in API Manager during runtime.


To apply a policy:

* Go to *API Manager > API Administration* and select the API instance from the details window.
* From the left navigation, select *Policies > Apply New Policy*:

* Expand the policy that you want to apply.
* Select the policy version and click *Configure Policy*.
+
For details about the configuration parameters for each of the policies, see the specific xref:policies-ootb-landing-page.adoc[policy documentation].
