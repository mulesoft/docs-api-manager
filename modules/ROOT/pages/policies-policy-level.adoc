Policies are by default applied to the entire API, unless configured otherwise. However, you can implement an additional level of granularity for policies, in which access is controlled based on a criteria. These are called _resource-level policies_. 

At the resource level of granularity, policies are applied to only those requests that match the criteria.  All policies, except the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, are resource-level.

With Mule 4, resource-level policy support now includes HTTP-based APIs along with RAML APIs, as opposed to support for only RAML APIs in Mule 3. A policy applied at a resource level affects all HTTP methods within the resource: PUT, GET, POST, and selected HTTP methods:

You can apply multiple conditions to filter your resources and HTTP methods using the xref:configire-uri-template-regex.adoc[URI template regex] to one, multiple, or all the methods in your API.

== Usage Scenarios for Implementing Resource Level Policies

The uses for resource level policies are limitless. Listed below are a few examples of how you might implement the resource-level policies:

* Applying policies to specific resources
* Securing a subset of an API
* Setting different limits on resources

If you have a RAML or OAS spec attached to your API, you can use the *Preview Resource Matching* option to check which resources are affected by your your filters:

A resource-level policy supports regular Java expressions. For example, you can use the wildcard to apply a policy to multiple resources. When you apply the policy to the API, specify the resources to which it applies:

== Guidelines for Implementing Resource Level Policies

When implementing policies at resource level:

* Do not use a placeholder, such as {userid}, in the regular expression. 
+
Using a placeholder in an expression fails because the placeholder does not match the actual node. In the example placeholder {userid}, the node looks something like this:
+
`/api/users/671962fc-f076-4b19-bc38-45ba3a4e4095/permissions/1234`
+
** 671962fc-f076-4b19-bc38-45ba3a4e4095 is the user ID
** 1234 is the ID of a permission
* Apply a policy to your resource by using the expression: `/api/users/{userid}` 
+
The `userid` represents a single user and all resource nodes:
+
`/api/users/.*`
* Use the expressions: `/api/users/{userId/permissions}` and `/api/users/{userid}/permissions/{permissionId}` to apply a policy to only the permissions resources:
+
`/api/users/.*/permissions.*`
