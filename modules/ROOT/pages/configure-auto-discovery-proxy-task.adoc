After you download and unzip a Mule 4 proxy, modify the config.properties file as described in this procedure. The config.properties file is located at the root of the proxy folder.

Configure the WSDL, RAML, HTTP, or HTTPS proxy using the following table, which shows the properties by API type that you need to configure in config.properties. The table includes the default values or no default (none). Some properties are not appropriate, and therefore not available (n/a), for certain API types. Property descriptions follow the table.

*Default Values of Properties*

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Property| WSDL | RAML | HTTP | HTTPS
| `api.id` | none | none | none | none
| `proxy.path` | / | /api/* | /api/* | /api/*
| `proxy.port` | 8080 | 8080 | 8080 | 443
| `proxy.response` | 10000 | n/a | n/a | n/a
| `implementation.host` | n/a | baseUri.com | baseUri.com | baseUri.com
| `implementation.port` | n/a | 80 | 80 | 443
| `implementation.path` | n/a | / | / | /
| `proxy.responseTimeout` | n/a | 10000 | 10000 | 10000
| `raml` | n/a | /api or a subfolder | n/a | n/a
| `keystore.path` | n/a | n/a | n/a | Location of keystore. Example: keystore.jks
| `keystore.key` | n/a | n/a | n/a | Provided when generating keystore
| `keystore.path` | n/a | n/a | n/a | Provided when generating keystore
| `wsdl`| Footnote | n/a | n/a | n/a
| service.namespace | Footnote | n/a | n/a | n/a
| service.name | Footnote | n/a | n/a | n/a
| service.port | Footnote | n/a | n/a | n/a
|===

*Footnote*: In this example, the properties in config.properties are service.name, service.name, service.port and the WSDL location is `+http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl+`. These properties relate to the WSDL as follows:

== Property Descriptions

* `api.id`: Generated by API Manager on API dashboard
* `proxy.response`: Time (ms) proxy waits for response before throwing timeout
* `proxy.responseTimeout`: Milliseconds proxy waits before throwing timeout
* `raml`: Location of raml files
+
You have to attach your API specification to the RAML proxy and provide a relative or absolute location of the root raml file.
* `wsdl`: Location of WSDL spec

Now, you are ready to regenerate the JAR.
