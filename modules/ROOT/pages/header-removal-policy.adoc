The Header Removal policy removes all listed headers from a request or a response of a message when you specify an inbound and outbound map of the headers that you want to remove with a key-value pair:

You can optionally include DataWeave expressions for Mule 4.0 and Mule runtime engine (Mule) expressions for Mule 3.0 and in the value of the header:

`“#[attributes.requestPath]”`

In this example, all the headers matching the configured expression are removed from the message.


== How This Policy Works

Because every header that matches a Header Removal policy parameter is removed from the message, you must be careful about how you configure that parameter. 

For example, the following parameter configuration removes any header starting with the word `Access-Control`, such as the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers from a message. The configuration also removes the `Cache-Control` header:

.Inbound Header
