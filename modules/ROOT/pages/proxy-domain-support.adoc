= Domain Support for Mule 4 API Proxies

Mule runtime engine enables you to share common resources among other Mule applications by defining these resources within a Mule domain. Other Mule applications can then inherit this domain.

This way, your Mule applications that are configured for it, can access the xref:4.1@mule-runtime::shared-resources.adoc[resources]declared in your domain. +

Because every auto-generated proxy is a preconfigured Mule application, you can also define multiple API proxies under the same domain. You install a domain when you auto-deploy multiple proxies that use the same host and port but have a different path. +

== API Proxies and Domains Overview

API Manager enables you to automatically configure an API proxy to inherit an existing domain. All API proxies use one of the following listener configurations when referencing a domain:

** For inbound HTTP endpoints: `api-proxy-listener-http`
** For inbound HTTPs endpoints: `api-proxy-listener-https`

Note that API domains are not supported by Runtime Fabric or CloudHub support API domains. 

*Important:* In an API domain, you may define several dependencies. Ensure that the versions of the dependencies defined in the domain have the same or later version than the ones defined in the API proxy that references the domain.

All the dependencies defined in the domain override the dependencies defined in the API proxy (older or newer). For example, if the API proxy depends on a functionality defined in the HTTP transport, but is referencing a domain using
 an older version of that transport, you will have errors at runtime.

=== Usage

API proxy listeners must inherit your proxy domain HTTP listener configuration by using the listener configuration defined in the target domain. 

The following code illusrates the HTTP listener configuration defined in a target domain:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="api-proxy-listener-http">
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" protocol="HTTP"/>
</http:listener-config>
----
For HTTP listener configuration defined in the domain, the listener setup on the API proxy must be defined as:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener config-ref="api-proxy-listener-http" path="${proxy.path}" responseStreamingMode="AUTO">
...
----

== Configure API Proxy Domain

To configure an API proxy to use a domain:
. Select *API Manager > API Administration* > *Manage API*.
> Select *Manage API from Excahnge* to import the API from either Exchange, or select *Import* to import from your local machine.
. Specify an API name, Asset type, API version, and Asset version.
. In *Managing Type*, select *Endpoint with Proxy*, and then in *Proxy deployment target*, select *Hybrid*.
. In *Mule Version*, select the *Check this box if you are managing this API in Mule 4 or above* checkbox.
. In *Implementation URI*, type your API URI. 
. Additionally specify:
.. A TLS Context, which is required if you plan to have xref:building-https-proxy.adoc[HTTPs] communications. 
.. The path for your implementation URI if it is different than `/`.
. Click the *Advanced Options* expander list.
. Select your schema (HTTP or HTTPS) and optionally specify an API instance label.
. Specify the port for your API proxy inbound connections, and optionally set a response timeout.
. Select the *Reference User Domain* checkbox.
. Click *Save*:

After saving the API proxy configuration, you can perform either of the following tasks:

* Deploy the API proxy to the selected target (*Settings*, under *Deployment Configuration*).
* Download the API proxy (*Actions*) and edit it in Anypoint Studio to customize your target domain before deploying it.

== Configuring a Domain for the First Time

To configure a domain for the first time:

. Obtain a domain artifact in one of the following ways:
.. Download the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/gateway-proxy-domain/[API Gateway domain template].
.. Develop your own custom domain, using the naming convention predefined in the autogeneated proxy: +
** `api-proxy-listener-http`: The listener configuration for HTTP communications 
** `api-proxy-listener-https`: The listener configuration for HTTPS communications
+
. Copy the Maven artifact to `../domains/` folder of your running runtime distribution, (for example, `gateway-proxy-domain-1.0.0-mule-application-template.jar`).+
*Tip:* Ensure that the name of the artifact and its Maven coordinates match:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<groupId>com.mulesoft.anypoint</groupId>
<artifactId>gateway-proxy-domain</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0</version>
<packaging>mule-domain</packaging>
----
. Customize the domain template to fit your usage scenarios.

When referencing a domain, Mule reads the domain Maven coordinates from the API proxy pom.xml file and looks for an already deployed domain with the same semantic name +
For example, in the case of an API gateway domain with the version specified in the previous example, the semantic name is: `gateway-proxy-domain-1.0.0-mule-domain`.

For a proxy to leverage the domain, you must ensure that the domain template is specified in the API proxy pom.xml as a provided dependency. 

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mulesoft.anypoint</groupId>
    <artifactId>gateway-proxy-domain</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <classifier>mule-domain</classifier>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

== Avoiding Port Conflicts

To successfully register an API, you must deploy the API proxy to a Mule instance using a unique endpoint URL. Automatically generated proxies use the path: `+http://0.0.0.0:8081+`. +

To avoid a conflict when running multiple proxies using the same domain, ensure that the proxy paths are unique. Additionally, if you have multiple domains deployed on the same Mule instance, each listener configuration must have a unique port for all domains to be successfully deployed and available to the deployed proxies.

=== API Gateway Domain Template

If you choose to download your API proxy and configure it manually on your end, you may use the *API Gateway domain template*.

The https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/gateway-proxy-domain/[API Gateway domain template] is configured to have a shared HTTP listener configuration ("api-proxy-listener-http") listening on the 8081 port. You can also have a shared HTTPs listener configuration ("api-proxy-listener-https"). 

To use either configuraton, you must uncomment code from your API Gateway domain template and configure your TLS context, such as, certificates and passwords. The following list provides the available listeners configurations:

* The `api-proxy-listener-http` listener configuration, which is used for HTTP communications, binds to all interfaces and uses port 8081 by default. 
* The `api-proxy-listener-https` listener configuration, which is used for HTTPS communications, binds to all interfaces.+
+
This domain includes a predefined `config.properties` file. This resource enables you to define settings dynamically without having to recompile the domain. +

The following example illustrates the properties in the config.properties file:

[source,Properties,linenums]
----
proxy.port=8081
implementation.protocol=HTTP
inbound.keystore.path=path
inbound.keystore.keyPassword=changeit
inbound.keystore.password=changeit
inbound.keystore.algorithm=
inbound.keystore.type=JKS
inbound.keystore.alias=alias
