== Add a New API

. Navigate to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*.
. In *API Administration*, click *Add API* and select *Add new API*.
. Select *Mule Gateway*.
. Select the *Proxy type* from the following options:
+
Connect to existing application (basic endpoint):::: Use this option to directly interact with a Mule
runtime Engine (Mule) application when your application is configured with API gateway autodiscovery. See xref:api-auto-discovery-new-concept.adoc[API Autodiscovery] for more information.
+
Select the *Mule version*.
+
Deploy a proxy application:::: Use this option to interact by proxy with an application, either because
it is a Mule application not configured with API gateway autodiscovery or because it is not a Mule application.
See xref:api-proxy-landing-page.adoc[Configure Proxies for your APIs] for more information.

. Configure the endpoint for your *Proxy type*:

Connect to existing application (basic endpoint)::::

| Field Name | Description | Required | Notes
| *API instance label* | Specifies a label for the API. | No | If you have multiple managed instances of the same API, add a label to differentiate each instance from the others.
| *Implementation URI* | The URL to access for the proxy or the API. | No |  For example, you can use the URL of your API asset in Exchange. 
| *Consumer endpoint* | Specifies a proxy application's address for consumers to use for sending requests.| No |

| *Base path* | Specifies the URL prefix for all API paths, relative to the host root. It must start with a leading slash /. | No | 
| **Advanced options** | | |
| *Proxy version* | Specifies the version of the proxy to use for the endpoint.| No |
| *TLS Context for outbound traffic* | Specifies the TLS context to secure outbound traffic.  | No |  Only available on Mule 4+.
| *Scheme* | Specifies whether to use HTTP or HTTPS for the validations. | Yes | If you select HTTPS, specify a TLS context for inbound traffic.
| *TLS Context for inbound traffic* | Specifies the TLS context to secure inbound traffic. | No |  Only available on Mule 4+.
| *Port* | Specifies the number to use if the displayed port is incorrect. | No | 
| *Request timeout* | Specifies the duration after which a request times out. | No | 
| *Domain* | Specifies whether to use an API gateway domain. | No | If you chose *Hybrid* as the proxy deployment target previously in the configuration, ensure that you select this option. You must install the API gateway domain in Mule 3.8 and later.
| *Enable Console* | Specifies whether you can expose and test your API specification. | No | You can specify a different path in *Console Path*, for example, "/spec/*". Only available if you have an attached API definition. Only available on Mule 3+.
| *Validations* | Specifies whether to validate inbound requests against a provided specification. | No | Only available if you have an attached API definition. Only available on Mule 3+.
| *Strict validations (optional)* | Specifies whether to validate inbound requests against query parameters. | No | Only available if you have an attached API definition. Only available on Mule 3+

== Notes

* Although OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.0 is supported, the callback feature is not. To work around this issue, either handle the callback outside of the Mule runtime engine domain or use an OAS 3.0 specification that does not use callbacks.
