= Deprecating an API instance on API Manager
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

While transitioning consumers of your API to an updated instance, you can prevent developers from signing up for access to your old API instance. As an API administrator, you mark an API as deprecated to remove the invitation for developers to request access from the portal page. Existing application contracts remain active but no new contracts can be created for that API instance. Deprecated APIs have an indicator in any location where they appear showing they are deprecated. A badge in search results indicates that the instance is deprecated.

. Go to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*.
. In *API Administration*, click the name of the API you want to deprecate. 
+
The API *Settings* detail appears:

. Select *Actions* > *Deprecate API*.
. Click *Ok*. 
+
The API is now deprecated.
