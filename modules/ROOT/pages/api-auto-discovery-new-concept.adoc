API Autodiscovery allows API Manager to manage an API that represents the HTTP endpoints of a Mule application. +
Essentially, it's the mechanism that links an HTTP resource, to its API definition in API Manager.

By configuring Autodiscovery in your Mule application you can use policy management, and API Analytics reporting from API Manager.

When Autodiscovery is correctly configured in your Mule application you can say that your application's API is _tracked by_ or paired to_ API Manager.

API Manager, shows your API status, represented as a green dot if the API is being tracked, or gray dot if Autodiscovery is not configured for your API. +
For an API to be tracked, you must meet the following conditions:

* The API must exist in API Manager.
* Mule Runtime must be configured to use Anypoint Platform credentials. +
These credentials give your application access to the API Configuration in your organization's API Manager.
+
[NOTE]
--
These credentials must be set before starting the Mule Runtime that executes your application.
--
* The Autodiscovery element must be configured in your Mule application. +
This XML element points to the specific API to which you want to link in API Manager.

An API on API Manager can be configured with either a basic endpoint, or a proxy endpoint. +
//_COMBAK: I'd like to introduce this concept a little earlier and explain the difference between the two, so I can refer to this in the coming paragraph:
If you configured a proxy endpoint, your autogenerated proxy will already be correctly configured with the Autodiscovery element, and if you choose to take advantage of the platform deployment capabilities, such as 1-Click deployment, the API Manager credentials will be automatically set for you as well.

No two Autodiscoveries can be associated to the same API in a Mule Runtime.
