The Simple authentication policy protects the API by requiring username and password when calling apps make a request. This policy is available only to an API you are managing in Mule 4 or later.

You can follow the general instructions for applying a policy, and enter the user name and password to configure the credentials.

You can also configure resource-level policies and methods.

After applying this policy to the API, a request to that API must contain the following header:

----
Authorization: Basic <username:password>
----

where username:password is a base64-encoded string. In Mac OS X or Linux, for example:

`echo '<Client Id>:<Client Secret>' | base64`
