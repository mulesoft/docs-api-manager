The policy sends back an "WWW-Authenticate" HTTP header field using the following format:`WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="mule-realm"`
|===

The Simple Authentication policy protects an API by forcing applications to provide a username and password when making requests. This policy is available only in Mule 4 or later.

The policy follows the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617[basic HTTP authentication standards].

== Configuring Policy Parameters

When you apply the Simple Authentication policy to an API, a request to that API must contain the following header:

----
Authorization: Basic <username:password>
----

The `username:password` must be a base64-encoded string. 

== Example

On a Mac OS X or Linux system, the username and password requirement is implemented as:

`echo '<Client Id>:<Client Secret>' | base64`
