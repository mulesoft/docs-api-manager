Anypoint Platform alerts you about request behavior, performance issues, actions related to client application contracts, and runtime events. The platform supports three types of alerts: API alerts, contracts alerts, and runtime alerts. API alerts and contracts alerts are managed by Anypoint API Manager (API Manager). Runtime alerts are managed by Anypoint Runtime Manager (Runtime Manager).

== API Alerts
 
Add and configure API alerts that flag unusual API behavior, such as:

* An API response time over 60 seconds
* More than 1000 API requests in 30 seconds 

See xref:add-api-alert-task.adoc[Adding an API Alert].

API Manager enables you to add the following API alerts to an API instance:

* *Policy Violation*
+
An infraction of one or more policies governing the API occurs.

* *Request Count*
+
Users request access to the API more times than allowed in a specified interval of time.
+
Specify time interval values from 1 through 999999999. To prevent data bursts, intervals are implemented as sliding windows instead of as absolute minute boundaries. See https://www.techopedia.com/definition/869/sliding-window[Sliding Windows].

* *Response Code*
+
The API returns one of these HTTP codes upon receiving a request: 400, 401, 403, 404, 408, 500, 502, or 503.

* *Response Time*
+
The response time of the API exceeds a specified timeout period. 

API alerts are triggered only when states change, although the first occurrence of a state change might be undetected due to newly created alerts not having defined states.

When configuring an API alert, you select Business Group users to receive email notifications about the alert. Notifications include information about events that trigger alerts as specified by severity level. Users receive the following:

* One email describes the alert:
+
`Your API, CesarDemoAPI - Basic:151 (Environment: "NewOne"), has received greater than 2 requests within 1 consecutive periods of 1 minute.`
+
* Another email notifies you when the alert is resolved.
+
`Your API Version, jsonplaceholderapi - 1.0.development, is no longer in an alert state. The number of policy violations was not greater than 1 in the last 1 consecutive periods of 1 minute.`

After an alert is triggered, API Manager sends the first set of two notification emails and stops listening for alerts until the next alert period begins. This technique prevents repeated notification emails.

Note: API Alerts are sent from `no-reply@mulesoft.com`. This cannot be customized.

== Contracts Alerts

API Manager automatically notifies users when actions related to contracts occur. For instance, when a client application requests access to an API instance, API Manager sends a notification with the status of the request. Depending on the configuration, status might indicate that the request is pending manual approval, or it might indicate that the request has been auto-approved.

The following actions trigger contracts alerts:

.Contracts
[%header]
|===
| Action | Recipient | Description
| Contract approved
| Client application owners
| User is notified that request access was approved.

| Contract auto-approved
| Organization administrators, environment administrators, contracts managers

[NOTE]
====
Contracts Alerts are sent from `no-reply@mulesoft.com`. This cannot be customized.

== Runtime Alerts

Alerts in Runtime Manager differ from API alerts and contracts alerts. For example, Runtime Manager flags CPU usage, secure data gateway status, and deployment success or failure. See xref:runtime-manager::alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Runtime Manager Alerts].

== Flex Gateway Alerts

Alerts for Flex Gateway differ from API alerts and contract alerts. For example, Flex Gateway includes *Alert Logic* options and the ability
to customize the subject and message of *Email notifications*. See xref:gateway::flex-use-api-alerts.adoc[Using Flex Gateway API Alerts]
for more information. 

== Alert Rate Limits

Anypoint Platform enforces rate limits that determine how often an alert is triggered, and how often email notifications are sent. 

See xref:runtime-manager::alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc#rate-limits-on-alerts[Rate Limits on Alerts] for information on enforced limits.
