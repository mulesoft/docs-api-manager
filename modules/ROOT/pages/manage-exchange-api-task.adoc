= Creating an API instance by importing from Exchange
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

You need to have access to an API in your organization's Exchange to perform this procedure. For example, in Design Center create an API and publish it to Exchange. After setting up the API to manage it from Exchange, the API version, status, and other information appears in API Manager. With this set up, you can configure and manage the API.

This procedure covers the configuration of the API. After saving the configuration, you can deploy the API.

. Click API Manager in tne Anypoint Platform navigation bar.
+
API Administration opens in your default environment, such as Sandbox.
+
. In API Administration, select Manage API > Manage API From Exchange.

+
. In Manage API from Exchange - API Configurations, select options:
+
* In API Name, type the first characters of the API name, and then API Manager displays APIs to choose from. Select the API you want to manage from the list of available APIs in Exchange. In API Version, select a version of the API. In Asset Version, select the Exchange asset version.
+
A link to the RAML/OAS specification for viewing appears.
+
* In Managing Type, choose Basic Endpoint or Endpoint with Proxy.
+
Set up a basic endpoint if you create your API outside API Manager, but you want to apply policies or otherwise manage the API using API Manager. For example, if you create the API using Mule Runtime, you don't need a proxy.
+
* In Implementation URI, replace the example by entering the URL of the site that hosts the API.
+
For example, you can use the URL of your API asset in Exchange. In this case, the API is consuming the JSONPlaceholder API, so enter `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`.
+
* If you choose Endpoint With Proxy, select a proxy deployment target CloudHub or Hybrid.
+
Hybrid is a product for managing servers.
+
If you chose Endpoint With Proxy, also accept the default Path `/` for the proxy endpoint, or enter another path. For example, changing the path to `/users` makes the REST call to the service at the implementation URI `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`.
. Click Save, or optionally set advanced options, and then save.
. In Advanced Options, optionally assign an instance label to the basic endpoint or proxy.
+
In case you create multiple instances, labeling them with a user-friendly name is recommended.
. Set a response timeout.
. If you choose Endpoint With A Proxy, also specify a scheme (HTTP or HTTPS) and a port, or accept the defaults.
. If you choose Hybrid as the proxy deployment target, check Reference User Domain to use an API Gateway domain.
+
You must install the API Gateway Domain in Mule 3.8 and later.
+
The API appears in the API administration dashboard.
