Resource level policy support includes RAML and HTTP APIs. A policy applied at a resource level affects all methods, or selected methods, within the resource.

You can apply multiple conditions to filter your resources and methods. The URI template regex can be applied to one, many or all the methods that your API has.

== Unsupported Policy

You cannot apply the CORS policy to resources.

== Usage Scenarios

The uses for resource level policies are limited mainly by your imagination. Here are a few possibilities:

* Applying policies to specific resources
* Securing a subset of an API
* Setting different limits on resources

If you have a RAML spec attached to your API, click Preview Resource Matching to check which resources your filters affect.
