You can create a new API version, import and export a version, managing the API life cycle, and deprecating APIs. When you create a new version of an API, it resides in Anypoint Platform with existing versions. The additional version can have its own RAML file, API Portal, and URL.

If you navigate back to the API Administration page, the new version is listed. Click the arrow to expand the list of versions. The most recently created version is at the top.

On the API version details page, in ADD A TAG, enter a tag name, such as Released, to signal the status of an API Version to users. The tag appears with the API in the list of APIs on the Developer portal for your organization.

The Add New Version capability is unavailable for APIs that you did not add to the platform yourself, unless you are an organization administrator. If you are assigned an API Versions Owner role for an API created by somebody else, you cannot create new versions of that API. Your assigned role might entitle you to edit an API version, but not to create a new version.

== Importing and Exporting an API Version

From the API Administration page, you can import a .zip file that contains an exported API version into an existing API. You cannot create a new API from an exported package.

On the API Administration page, select Import from the Add Version dropdown to import the exported API into a new version of an existing API.

From the API version details page, you can export an API version. The total size of the exported file with images and attachments is limited to 100MB. The exported .zip file can include the following things:

* API name
* API version name
* API version description
* RAML files
* Policy state and definitions
* SLA tier definitions
* Images
* File attachments
