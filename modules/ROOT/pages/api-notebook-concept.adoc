[WARNING]
API Notebook was deprecated in November 2017. 

API Notebook is an open source, shareable web application for API documentation, interactive API tutorial and example generatation, and a client for your API endpoints. Using API Notebook, you can make requests and quickly transform the responses into readable format.

API Notebook creates a client for an API when you specify the URL for the RAML spec. You can use autocomplete on the client object to explore the API . With a well-defined RAML file, method definitions appear in the tool-tip hints. API Notebook supports OAuth and unsigned requests. With the client you can send authenticated requests to the API and receive live data in return.
