= Configuring an API Endpoint in API Manager
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

How you configure your API endpoint to manage application requests depends on the relationship between your Mule application and your API:

* Basic API endpoint configuration
+
Use this option to directly interact with a Mule runtime Engine (Mule) application when your application is configured with API gateway autodiscovery.
+
* Proxy API endpoint configuration
+
Use this option to interact by proxy with an application, either because it is a Mule application not configured with API gateway autodiscovery or because it is not a Mule application. 

To configure your API endpoint:

. In API Manager, select the instance of the API for which you want to configure an endpoint.
+
.The screen capture shows how to create and configure an endpoint for the selected API.

+
<1> A tag for the API endpoint
<2> The endpoint type: basic or proxy
<3> The client provider, if you have configured an external client provider
. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the *API Configuration* section.
. In the *Managing Type* field, select the endpoint type:
* *Basic Endpoint*
* *Endpoint With Proxy*
+
You can accept the default Path `/` for the proxy endpoint or enter another path. 
. If you are configuring a *Basic Endpoint*, perform the following steps:
.. In the *Application type* section, specify whether your application uses a Hybrid or CloudHub environment, or if you are running a non-Mule application managed by Anypoint Service Mesh.
.. Select the *Mule version* box if you want to manage APIs in Mule 4 or later.
.. If you are creating the endpoint with proxy, in the *Implementation URI* field, specify the URL of the site that hosts the API, for example, `+http://product.mydomain.com+`.
+
Otherwise, you can skip this step.
. If you are configuring an *Endpoint With Proxy*, perform the following steps:
+
.The screen capture shows how to create and configure an endpoint for the selected API.

.. In the *Proxy deployment target* section, specify whether the proxy deployment target is a CloudHub or a Hybrid installation. Choose Hybrid if you are managing servers.
.. Select the *Mule version* box if you want to manage APIs in Mule 4 or later.
.. If you are creating the endpoint with proxy, in the *Implementation URI* field, specify the URL of the site that hosts the API, for example, `+http://product.mydomain.com+`.
+
Otherwise, you can skip this step.
.. In the *TlS Context for outbound traffic* field, click *Add TLS Context* and specify the TLS context to secure outbound traffic.
.. In *Path*, specify the path.
.. Click *Advanced options* to specify additional settings.
... From *Proxy version*, choose the proxy version that you are currently using.
... * If you want to test your API specification, select *Enable Console* and optionally specify a different path in *Console Path*, for example, "/spec/*".  
... In *Validations*, select the box if you want to validate inbound requests against a specification. 
+
You can optionally specify the use of query parameters for strict validations.
... In *Scheme*, specify whether you want to use an HTTP or an HTTPs schema.
... In *API instance label*, specify a label for the API.
... In *Port*, specify the port number to use for the requests.
+
`8081` is the default port number. You can modify this port number, if required.
... Optionally, in *Response timeout*, specify the time (in seconds) after which the response must time out.
... Optionally, from *Client provider*, select the identity provider (IdP) that you want to use to authenticate access to this API from registered client applications.
+
If no client providers are set up for your environment and organization, this field is not visible.
. Optionally, scroll up to *API Configuration* and click *ADD A TAG* to enter a tag name (for example: `Released`) to display the status of an API version to users.
. Click *Save*.
