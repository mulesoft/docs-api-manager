You can customize your API Instance to fit your specific situation with the following optional configurations.
Not all options are available depending on the runtime as well as the API.

== Configure an API Instance on Flex Gateway Options

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="15%,35%,15%,35%"]
|===
| Field Name | Description | Required | Notes
| *API instance label* | Specifies a label for the API. | No | If you have multiple managed instances of the same API, add a label to differentiate each instance from the others.
| *Implementation URI* | The URL to access for the proxy or the API. It must end with a /. | Yes|  For example, you can use the URL of your API asset in Exchange. 
| *Consumer endpoint* | Specifies a proxy application's address for consumers to use for sending requests.| No |
| *Base path* | Specifies the URL prefix for all API paths, relative to the host root. It must start with a leading slash /. | No | 
| *Scheme* | Specifies whether to use HTTP or HTTPS. | Yes | If you select HTTPS, specify a TLS context for inbound traffic.
| *TLS Context for inbound traffic* | Specifies the TLS Context used for the inbound traffic of HTTPS APIs. | No | xref:gateway::flex-conn-tls-config.adoc[Configure a TLS Context for Flex Gateway] before adding a TLS Context to your API.
| *Port* | Specifies the number to use if the displayed port is incorrect. | No | Port can be shared between API instances over the same Target as long as the Base paths are different. Only available on Flex 1.2.0+.
| *Client provider* | Specifies a client provider for the API. | No | Anypoint Platform acts as the client provider by default. To configure an external client provider, see xref:access-management::managing-api-clients.adoc[Client Providers]. 
| **Advanced Options** |  |  |
| *TLS Context for outbound traffic* | Specifies the TLS Context used for the outbound traffic. | No | xref:gateway::flex-conn-tls-config.adoc[Configure a TLS Context for Flex Gateway] before adding a TLS Context to your API.

== Configure an API Instance on Mule Gateway Options

The options available when adding an API Instance using the Mule Gateway as the runtime depends on whether you want to create a basic endpoint or an endpoint with proxy, whether you include an API definition with your API Instance, and whether the API was created using Mule 3 or Mule 4.

| *Request timeout* | Specifies the duration after which a request times out. | No | 
| *Domain* | Specifies whether to use an API gateway domain. | No | If you chose *Hybrid* as the proxy deployment target previously in the configuration, ensure that you select this option. You must install the API gateway domain in Mule 3.8 and later.
