* Compliance
* Security
* Quality of Service
* Transformation

After selecting a category, you can further filter the list by the type of protection it fulfills.

== Policy Categories

The following table lists the policy name, the category and the characteristic the policy fulfills. +
You can only apply one policy of each characteristic to a specific resource. If using resource level policies you can apply the same policy, or a policy providing an already provided characteristic, more than once as long as there is no overlapping between them on the resources that they apply to.
