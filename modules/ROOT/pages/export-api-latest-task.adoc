After creating an API instance, you can export it. This exports the API instance endpoint configuration and Exchange asset relationship. You can then import it into another API Manager environment to create a new API instance. 

The export file is created as follows:

* File format: ZIP
* File name format: {API name}-{version}-{API instance ID}
* File size: 100MB or smaller ZIP file

[NOTE]
====
The following information is not exported with the API instance: 

* The client provider configuration, which is extracted from the target environment when the API instance is imported. 
* Information stored in the asset such as contracts, policies, and API specifications. To share this, you can promote the API instance in an API group. 
====

To export an API instance:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*.
. In *API Administration*, click the name of the API you want to export.

The API *Settings* detail appears:

. Select *Actions* > *Export API*.

Your API instance is now successfully exported.
