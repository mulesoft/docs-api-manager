After creating an API instance, you can export it to a 100MB or smaller `.zip` file. You can later import the file into API Manager to create a new API instance. The format of the name of the exported file is {API name}-{version}-{API instance ID}.

To export an API instance:

. In Anypoint Platform, click API Manager.
. On the API administration dashboard, click the API instance link.
. Click Export.
