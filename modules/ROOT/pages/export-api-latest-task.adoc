After creating an API instance, you can export it. This exports the API instance endpoint configuration and Exchange asset relationship. You can then import it into another environment in the same business group to create a new API instance. 

The export file is created as follows:

* File format: ZIP
* File name format: `{API name}-{version}-{API instance ID}`
* File size: 100 MB or smaller

[NOTE]
====
The following information is not exported with the API instance: 

* The client provider configuration, which is extracted from the target environment when the API instance is imported. 
* Information stored in the asset such as contracts, policies, and API specifications. To share this, you can promote the API instance in an API group. 
====

To export an API instance:

. Navigate to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*.
. In *API Administration*, click the name of the API you want to export. 
. Click *Actions* and select *Export API*.
+
Your API instance is now successfully exported.
