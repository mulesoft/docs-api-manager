In Mule 4, WSDL, RAML, HTTP, and HTTPS proxies handle errors and requests as described in the following tables. Mule 4 returns different error codes, depending on the proxy type, or no error code in response to problematic requests. This table shows whether or not Mule returns a 504, 400, or 404 error code when your WSDL, RAML, HTTP, and HTTPS proxy receives a problematic request.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Error Code | WSDL | RAML | HTTP | HTTPS
| 504: request timeout                                                                                                | yes  | yes  | yes  | yes
| 400: bad request (validation result)                                                                                | no   | yes  | no   | no
| 404: not found (resource or method not found in API spec)                                                           | no   | yes  | no   | no

The following table shows the impact of your web service and matching proxy on a request that goes through the proxy:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Impact | WSDL | RAML | HTTP | HTTPS
| Includes X-Forwarded-For headers.                                                                                           | yes  | yes  | yes  | yes
| Sends received headers to implementation API except Mule-included ones. See footnote.                                                     | yes  | yes  | yes  | yes
| Validates headers, body, and Uri, query, and  form parameters API against RAML 0.8/1.0.                                     | no   | yes  | no   | no
| Provides default parameter values if specified in RAML but absent from request.                                             | no   | yes  | no   | no
| Handles a secure connection using the keystore and truststore provided in the TLS configuration for server authentication. | no   | no   | no   | yes
